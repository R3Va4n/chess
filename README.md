# chess
a try to make chess and a bot to play against

chess is well known and i won't explain it here
the bot on the other hand:
- minimax algorithm
- (hopefully) AI evaluation of board states
- im already overscoping

project is using the minimum viable product workflow (aka get it to work somehow and then make it work properly)
